mixing electronics and biology

physical time vs computer time

neuromorphic computing (2014 TrueNorth) - massive parallel digital circuits that are calculating SNNs
(from 2018) Loihi - fully digital and asynchronous

understand biology by building


microcontroller ~ 10s of mW
neuromorphic ~ \muW

- good for low dimensional signals (10s to hundreds of neurons)
cons:
- high area
- high variability - very noisy
- low accuracy
