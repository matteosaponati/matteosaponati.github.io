### long-story short

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en.html" target="_blank"> Institute of Neuroinformatics </a> from the ETH and the University of Zurich (Switzerland), working in the <a href="https://grewelab.org/ " target="_blank"> Neural Learning and Intelligent Systems </a> and the  <a href="https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en/research/groups/ncs.html " target="_blank"> Neuromorphic Cognitive Systems  </a> groups.

I was a PhD student in Neurophysics at the <a href="https://www.ru.nl/science/dcn/" target="_blank">Donders Center for Neuroscience</a> from the Radboud University, Nijmegen (The Netherlands). I am planning to defend at the end of November 2023. During my PhD, I worked at the <a href="https://www.esi-frankfurt.de/" target="_blank">Ernst Strüngmann Institute for Neuroscience</a> in cooperation with the Max-Planck Society, in Frankfurt Am Main (DE), in the lab of Prof. Dr. <a href="https://www.martinvinck.com/" target="_blank">Martin Vinck</a>. I studied predictive processes and learning in single neurons and neural networks. My PhD research was supported by an International Max-Planck Research School (<a href="https://brain.mpg.de/imprs" target="_blank">IMPRS</a>) Fellowship.

Before, I spent 5 months working as an Assistant Research Scientist at the <a href="https://ins-amu.fr/" target="_blank">Institute des Neurosciences des Systèmes</a> from the Aix-Marseille University, Marseille (France). I worked in the <a href="https://ins-amu.fr/tng" target="_blank">Theoretical Neuroscience Group</a> of Prof. Viktor Jirsa, where I developed and implemented computational models to describe neuronal coupling at different spatial scales.

I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Physics at the  <a href="https://www.unipi.it/index.php/english" target="_blank">University of Pisa</a> (IT).  I worked with Enrico Cataldo from the Department of Physics and with <a href="https://www.santannapisa.it/en/alberto-mazzoni" target="_blank">Alberto Mazzoni</a> from the <a href="https://www.santannapisa.it/en/institute/biorobotics" target="_blank">Sant'Anna Biorobotics Institute</a> (IT). During my master's studies, I investigated how the collective dynamics of spiking neurons can give rise to oscillatory activity, and how this supports information transmission between different brain areas. I obtained an Erasmus+ grant to spend 3 months working in the <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/dsb" target="_blank">Dynamical Systems Biology lab</a> of Prof. Jordi Garcia Ojalvo at the <a href="https://www.prbb.org/" target="_blank">Barcelona Biomedical Research Park</a> (ESP). 

My hometown is Viareggio, in Italy. I spent all my childhood, teenage, and university years in this relatively small city on the Tuscanian coast. I have a very strong emotional connection with the sea, the sun, the smell of "salmastro" (Italian word for water saline), and the carnival. I am a musician, and I have been playing in many different bands and projects from Tuscany during that whole period. Nowadays, I make my own music, and I love to hang out with musicians and take part in whatever possible, random jam session - it makes me feel alive.
