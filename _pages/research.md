My research focuses on understanding the principles of learning in single neurons, how they support the ability of our brains to solve novel and complex tasks, and how these principles can be effectively modeled and applied for the creation of more intelligent machines. I pursue these questions using analytical and numerical tools, within a multidisciplinary approach getting inspiration from physics, theoretical neuroscience and machine learning. With my research endeavor, I plan to develop novel models and learning algorithms for bio-inspired computing, and apply my research for Neuromorphic engineering solutions to real-world problems. 

In essence, understanding how many small and pretty complex machines - the neurons - communicate and organize is still a fundamental, and beautiful challenge. Taking inspiration from their learning and organization principles, we would be able to build novel smart machines that can solve complex problems, and help us progress to a better society. This sounds pretty exciting to me.
