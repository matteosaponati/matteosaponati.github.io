understanding how many small and pretty complex machines - the neurons - communicate and self-assemble is still a fundamental, and beautiful challenge. Taking inspiration from their learning and organization principles, we would be able to build novel smart machines that can solve complex problems, and help us progress to a better society. This sounds pretty exciting to me. I try to do this using analytical and numerical tools, within a multidisciplinary approach getting inspiration from physics, theoretical neuroscience, and machine learning. 

### projects
- theory and algorithms for synaptic plasticity and learning rules in single neurons
- neuron-wise objective functions, optimization at the single neuron level, and self-organizing networks
- biologically inspired hierarchical learning for invariant data representation in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)
- neuromorphic engineering solutions, bio-inspired hardware, and Machine Learning (ML) on devices
