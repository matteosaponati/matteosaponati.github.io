### long-story short

From October 2023, I will be a postdoctoral fellow at the [Institute of Neuroinformatics](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en.html) from the ETH and the University of Zurich (CH), working in the [Neural Learning and Intelligent Systems](https://grewelab.org/) and the [Neuromorphic Cognitive Systems](https://www.ini.uzh.ch/en/research/groups/ncs.html) groups.

Currently, I am a PhD student in Neurophysics at the [Donders Center for Neuroscience](https://www.ru.nl/science/dcn/) from the [Radboud University](ru.nl/en), Nijmegen (The Netherlands). I am in the last stages of my PhD, and I am planning to defend at the end of Novemeber 2023. During my PhD, I have been working at the [Ernst Strüngmann Institute for Neuroscience](https://www.esi-frankfurt.de/) in cooperation with the Max-Planck Society, in Frankfurt Am Main (DE), in the lab of Prof. Dr. [Martin Vinck](https://www.martinvinck.com/), studying predictive processes and learning in single neuron and neural networks. My PhD research has been supported by an International Max-Planck Research School ([IMPRS](https://brain.mpg.de/imprs)) Fellowship I obtained in September 2019.

Before, I spent 7 months working as an Assistant Research Scientist at the <a href="https://ins-amu.fr/" target="_blank">Institute des Neurosciences des Systèmes</a> from the Aix-Marseille University, Marseille (France). I worked in the <a href="https://ins-amu.fr/tng" target="_blank">Theoretical Neuroscience Group</a> of Prof. Viktor Jirsa, where I developed and implemented computational models to describe neuronal coupling at different spatial scales.

I obtained my Bachelor and Master degree in Physics at the [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/index.php/english) (IT).  I worked with [Enrico Cataldo](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Enrico-Cataldo) from the department of physics, and with Alberto Mazzoni from the [Sant'Anna Biorobotics Institute](https://www.santannapisa.it/en/institute/biorobotics) (IT). During my master's studies, I investigated how the collective dynamics of spiking neurons can give rise to oscillatory activity, and how this supports information transmission between different brain areas. I obtained an Erasmus+ grant to spent 3 months working in the [Dynamica Systems Biology lab](https://www.upf.edu/web/dsb) of Prof. Jordi Garcia Ojalvo at the [Barcelona Biomedical Research Park](https://www.prbb.org/) (ESP). 

My hometown is Viareggio, in Italy. I spent all my childhood, teenager and university years in this relative small city on the Tuscanian coast. I have a very strong emotional connection with the sea, the sun, the smell of "salmastro" (italian word for water saline), and carnival. I am a musician, and I had been playing in many different bands and projects from Tuscany during that whole period. Nowadays, I make my own music, and I love to hang out with musician and take parts of whatever possible, random jam session - it makes me feel alive.
